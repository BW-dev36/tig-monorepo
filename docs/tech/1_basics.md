# 1. Basics

## 1.1. Overview

The Innovation Game (TIG) is the first coordination protocol designed specifically for algorithmic innovation. At the core of TIG lies a novel variant of proof-of-work called optimisable proof-of-work (OPoW).

OPoW uniquely integrates multiple proof-of-works to be featured, "binding" them in a manner prevents centralization due to optimizations of the proof-of-work algorithms. This resolves a longstanding issue that had hindered proof-of-work from being based on real-world computational scientific challenges.

TIG combines a crypto-economic framework with OPoW to:

1. Incentivise miners, referred to as Benchmarkers, to adopt the most efficient proof-of-work algorithms contributed openly to TIG. This incentive is derived from sharing block rewards proportional to the number of solutions found.
2. Incentivise contributors, known as Innovators, to optimise existing proof-of-work algorithms and invent new ones. Their incentive is tied to sharing block rewards based on adoption of their algorithms by Benchmarkers.

TIG will progressively phase in proof-of-works over time, directing innovative efforts towards the most significant challenges in science.

## 1.2. Blocks

In TIG, a block serves as the fundamental unit of time, roughly equivalent to 60 seconds. Blocks fulfil two primary functions:

1. Timestamp for when Benchmarkers start & submit their solutions
2. Execution of OPoW-related state transitions, determining Benchmarkers' influence and algorithm adoption, leading to the distribution of block rewards denominated in TIG tokens.

## 1.3. Rounds

A round spans 10,080 blocks, approximately equivalent to 604,800 seconds or 7 days. Rounds serve three primary purposes:

1. Execution of algorithm related state transitions.
2. Coordination of protocol and configuration updates, including the introduction of new challenges and voting procedures.
3. The token emission schedule is structured around rounds.

## 1.4. Token Emission Schedule

TIGâ€™s token emission schedule comprises 5 tranches, each with the same total emission of 26,208,000 TIG, but successively doubling in duration (measured in rounds):

| **Tranche** | **#Rounds** | **Emissions per block** | **Emissions per round** | **Start Date** | **End Date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 26  | 100 | 1,008,000 | 24 Nov 2023 | 30 May 2024\* |
| 2   | 52  | 50  | 504,000 | 31 May 2024\* | 30 May 2025\* |
| 3   | 104 | 25  | 252,000 | 31 May 2025\* | 29 May 2027\* |
| 4   | 208 | 12.5 | 126,000 | 30 May 2027\* | 24 May 2031\* |
| 5   | 416 | 6.25 | 63,000 | 25 May 2031\* | 14 May 2039\* |

Post tranche 5, rewards are solely based on tokens generated from license fees paid by commercial entities purchasing licenses.

## 1.5. TIG Token

The [TIG token contract](../tig-token/TIGToken.sol) is derived from OpenZepplin's ERC20 standard and is deployed to Basechain at the following address: [0x0C03Ce270B4826Ec62e7DD007f0B716068639F7B](https://basescan.org/token/0x0C03Ce270B4826Ec62e7DD007f0B716068639F7B).

TIG tokens earned during a round are minted within 7 days following the conclusion of that round.
