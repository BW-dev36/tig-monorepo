including any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute,

Source Code Form, subject to Section 3.1 above, and You must inform

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice, 
provided that, You, also comply with the requirements of this License for 
the Covered Software. 

3.4. Provision of Product

available, and You must publicly state how a third party can obtain a 
copy of such Product Information by reasonable means in a timely manner, 
at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient. 

3.5. Notices 

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices 
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or 
limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the 
Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the 
extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies. 

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation 

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this

and (b) describe the limitations and the code or information they affect. 
Such description must be placed in a text file included with all 
distributions of the Covered Software under this License and any relevant 
Product Information. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or 
regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient 
of ordinary skill to be able to understand it. 

5. Termination 

The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You 
fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, 
then the rights granted under this License from TIG or a particular 
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until TIG or 
such Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) 
on an ongoing basis, if TIG or such Contributor fails to notify You of 
the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You 
have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants, from TIG or a 
particular Contributor, are reinstated on an ongoing basis if TIG or such 
Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, 
this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with 
this License from TIG or such Contributor, and You become compliant prior 
to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice. 

6. Disclaimer of Warranty 

Covered Software is provided under this License and Product Information 
is provided pursuant to this License on an "as is" basis, without 
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, 
including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software and 
Product Information, as the case may be, is free of defects, 
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The 
entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software 
and Product Information is with You. Should any Covered Software or 
Product Information prove defective in any respect, You (not TIG or any 
Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or 
correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part 
of this License. No use of Product Information, or use of any Covered 
Software is authorized under this License, except under this 
disclaimer. 

7. Limitation of Liability 

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort 
(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall TIG, any 
Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted 
above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, 
or consequential damages of any character including, without 
limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, 
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages 
or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the 
possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not 
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such 
partyâ€™s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such 
limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation 
of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and 
limitation may not apply to You. 

8. Miscellaneous 

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject 
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be 
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent 
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides 
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter 
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor or 
against TIG.
